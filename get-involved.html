                        Our First Response Volunteers will be responsible for providing a 24/7 crisis helpline, as well as
                    emotional support chat service, for which detailed training will be provided free-of-cost. If and
                    when required service users request legal and/or clinical care navigation, volunteers will direct
                    the service users to their Supervisor for further processes. The volunteers play a vital role in how
                    Spotlight runs by providing unconditional positive regard and commitment to the victims of abuse who
                    come forward seeking help.
