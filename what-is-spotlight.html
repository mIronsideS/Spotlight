        Spotlight is a non-profit, online victim support service that provides 24/7 crisis help, emotional support chat, as well as care navigation to victims of abuse all over India. 

<br><br>
While we acknowledge the existence of various established crisis hotlines and listening services, Spotlight stands out as it endeavours to become an all-from-one-source support for victims of abuse all over India, regardless of their gender or background by providing care navigation, emotional support and crisis help. The most significant aspect of Spotlight is that it is fully online in order to facilitate accessibility. Service users can avail help primarily through social media, although other options such as email and direct call are available.   
<br><br>
Although our services are free-of-cost, when a service user avails legal or clinical help, the service user may sometimes be required to pay service fee to either the lawyers or mental health professionals. It is imperative to note that we attempt to make support to victims as affordable and accessible as possible and this aspect is always given priority.
